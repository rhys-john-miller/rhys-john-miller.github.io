I am currently a PhD studend at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-computer-science),  within the [Surrey Centre for Cyber Security (SCCS)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/surrey-centre-cyber-security"). My PhD is aimed at exploring security analysis techniques of systems using emerging 5G technologies.

Research Interests
======
  - Formal Security Analysis: development of formal frameworks and tools for security (protocol) analysis
  - provable security: generic framework development, protocol design, security proofs
  - formal verification (especially model checking), applied logics
  - wireless, mobile and IoT security: e.g., distance-bounding, RFID/NFC security, 5G
