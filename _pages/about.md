I am a PhD student at the University of Surrey in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-computer-science). I am a part of [Surrey Centre for Cyber Security (SCCS)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/surrey-centre-cyber-security"), with my PhD specializing in the formal verification of emerging 5G technology. With a background in computer science and a strong interest in mathematics, I am dedicated to using formal methods to ensure the correctness and reliability of next-generation wireless communication systems. My research focuses on developing formal models of 5G technology and using model checking and other formal methods to verify that the system satisfies the necessary properties and specifications. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of safe and secure 5G systems that can support a wide range of applications and services. Outside of my research, I enjoy staying up to date on the latest developments in computer science and mathematics and engaging with the academic community through conferences and seminars.
